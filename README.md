#Cross-Platform Messaging Client

This messaging client provides inmates with the opportunity to communicate in real-time with their loved ones through an email client specifically tailored for the use in prison facilities. Loved ones initiate conversations with inmates for a specific "mailing rate". They may then choose to provide "return postage" so that inmates may reply. Loved ones may send text and images, while inmates may only respond with text. Many restrictions are placed on this client due to security concerns. This repository contains the code for the two separate components of this messaging client - a kiosk version intended for use by inmates and a responsive version used by those communicating with said inmates.
